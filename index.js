before you can run the bot on a new machine 
1. open the modules installer
2. put your own tokens in these files:

  Step 1: discord token in config.json (line 4)
  Step 2: osu tokens in config.json (line 6 until line 11 after k=your-token)
  Step 3: beatconnect token in config.json (line 16)

  you can get the tokens from:
    discord token:
      https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/app-id/bots
    osu token:
      https://old.ppy.sh/p/api
    beatconnect token:
      private, ask the creator for token

3. open run.bat

Please just use for reference
