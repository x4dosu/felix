            IMPORTANT:

            exports.run = async (client, message, args, p) => {
                const response = await client.snekfetch.get(client.config.danbooru);
                const json = await response.body;
                console.log(json);
            }

            LIST OF ALL COMMANDS I HAVE TO REWRITE:
            everything in:
                ./commands/functions
            danbooru.js
