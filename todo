            6. add compare command

            ^-//maybe even rewrite full command and make it more similar to the beatconnect cmd

            (config.js):

            1. add more configurations to config.js (maybe add user configurations)

            1. fix [ws] [connection] Server closed the WebSocket connection: 1000
            2. look for other todos I wrote down within the bot
            3. add me command

            (esex.js / message.js esex function)
