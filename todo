            Steps before I release the bot:

            Step 1: Remove discord token from config.json
            Step 2: Remove osu tokens from config.json
            Step 3: Remove beatconnect token from config.json
            Step 4: Remove beatconnect docs from config.json


            Actual todo (not in an order):

            (beatconnect.js):

            1. add random and other own order functions to beatconnect.js
            2. add other gamemodes for beatconnect
            3. improve beatconnect in general //i mean idk its kinda alright already??
            
            (osu.js):

            1. implement other gamemodes than standard to all the osu commands (
                taiko pp: https://www.npmjs.com/package/taiko-pp-calc
                cbt pp: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ctb-pp-calc
                mania pp: https://www.npmjs.com/package/wifipiano2
            )

            2. add if fc pp calc & star rating to gatari top command

            3. add osu sig (it looks cool (
                osusig: https://lemmmy.pw/osusig/
            ))

            4. rewrite bloodcat command when it's back
            5. show map completion & maybe tries
            6. add compare command
            7. add if less than four results to $osu maps 
            ^-//maybe even rewrite full command and make it more similar to the beatconnect cmd

            (config.js):

            1. add more configurations to config.js (maybe add user configurations)

            (general things):

            1. fix [ws] [connection] Server closed the WebSocket connection: 1000
            2. look for other todos I wrote down within the bot
            3. add me command
            4. add something that you can do when you're pregnant //hgoly shit what is wrong with me
            5. add sleep and wake up command to count how long someone is sleeping //cool idea by badgraphics :3

            (esex.js / message.js esex function)

            1. add esex counter
            2. fix multiple esex requests at once idk
